            <h2>The Accordion</h2>
            <p>The accordion is a graphical control element comprising a vertically stacked list of items, such as labels or thumbnails. Each item can be "expanded" or "collapsed" to reveal content associated with that item.</p>

                <article>
                    The accordion is a useful UI component when you want to present a list of items or categories, allowing users to quickly
                    navigate and access specific content. It's especially effective for organizing content that has varying levels of
                    importance or detail. Accordion menus are commonly used in FAQs, product features, and content-heavy interfaces.

                    <h5>Show/Hide operation</h5>
                    <p>An accordion always contains the category title, an expanded and collapsed state, an icon indicating expansion, and the spacing between them.</p>

                    <p>A list of items where exactly ane item is expanded into a panel.</p>

                    <h4>What if the user clicks on collapsed card while another card is open?</h4>
                </section>
                <article>
                    When a user clicks on a collapsed card while another card is open in the accordion, the previously open card should
                    automatically collapse. This behavior ensures that only one card is open at a time, providing a seamless user experience
                    and preventing clutter. Users can focus on the content they're interested in without being overwhelmed by multiple
                    expanded cards.

                <article>
                    Selecting an icon to indicate expansion in an accordion depends on the overall design and visual language of your
                    application. Common choices include a "down arrow" pointing towards the expanded content and an "up arrow" indicating a
                    collapsed state. You can also use a "plus" symbol for expansion and a "minus" symbol for collapse. Choose an icon that
                    is intuitive and easily recognizable by your target audience.
